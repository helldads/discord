	'Democracy Officer': [
		'Greetings, Helldiver. The Galactic War awaits.',
		"You're here. The Galaxy awaits your salvation.",
		"Helldiver, take command of the Galaxy's liberation.",
		'The siege upon Managed Democracy continues. Let us rally to her defence.',
		'The hour of our next victory rapidly approaches. Let us cleanse the Galaxy of alien scum.',
		'The freedom of the Galaxy remains in jeopardy. Let us join the fight.',
		'Managed Democracy calls for aid. Only you can answer, Helldiver.',
		'Innocents perish with every wasted second. We must act.',
		"Liberty's enemies march ever closer.",
		"Lady Liberty's calls for aid haunt my dreams.",
		'Every star is a distress beacon, crying out for Liberation.',
		'Every moment we ruminate, another family is torn limb from limb. We must strike.',
		"Your fellow Helldivers rage against the enemy's tyranny. Join them.",
		'Helldivers across the Galaxy are fighting for every inch of territory. Where will you join them?',
		'Liberty calls for aid across the galaxy; only you can decide where to answer.',
		'We must give no less than the entirety of our being in service to Freedom.',
		'A true servant of Freedom keeps no companion, save Damsel Democracy herself.',
		'Our enemies forsook mercy long ago. Oblivion is all that awaits them now.',
		'The enemy may anticipate but one outcome: total annihilation.',
		'Managed Democracy offers true Freedom: Freedom from the burden of choice.',
		'The people of Super Earth look to us for hope. And we will deliver it—one enemy corpse at a time.',
		"I only regret that I have but one ship's worth of lives to give to our cause.",
		'Ours are the hands that will tear asunder the binds of tyranny.',
		'Go now, Helldiver. Let our enemies take no step that is not hindered by the corpse of their comrade.',
		'Go now, and should you fall, remember this: Every day is a good day to die for Democracy.',
		'Let them come. Let them brawl. Let them face the insurmountable might of the Helldivers.',
		'Go now—and fear the shadow of neither death nor tyranny, for Justice is your cause.',
		'All the galaxy looks to you for salvation. Let nothing stand in the way of Liberty.',
		"The fate of all humanity's children are in your hands. Do not let them fall.",
		'You are the best of the best. Live up to your name. Live up to Freedom.',
		'Today the light of Liberty will grace the skies of this world once more.',
		'Let our enemies choke upon their territorial ambitions.',
		'History will remember your deeds this day.',
		"Today you've carved another foothold in the long climb to Liberty.",
		'Another victory for the right side of history.',
		'You have maintained our way of life.',
		'Democracy prevails once more.',
		'Victory was never in doubt.',
		'Return, refit, and redeploy to purge the stain of this failure with the peroxide of victory.',
		'Defeat is but the catalyst of its own rectification.',
		'They abandoned our mission and our cause. Execution was our only choice.',
		'There is but one sentence commensurate to the crime of treason.',
		'I realized long ago that death in the defense of Freedom was not a tragedy to be lamented, but a sacrifice to be revered.',
		'All of posterity shall either prosper in Liberty, or suffer in bondage. That determination is our duty.',
		"As the chain does not scrutinize the brevity of its links, neither does Liberty mourn the transience of a Helldiver's service.",
		'Here at war, you may cast your vote many times. Once on Election Day, and another with every bullet buried in an enemy combatant.',
		'Remain ever-vigilant for deceit and treachery. They can take root in the smallest of cracks.',
		'Dissidents sow their lies in the smallest of fractures, Helldiver. Stay vigilant.',
		"The lives of Humanity's present are a crumb; the lives of Humanity's future, a boundless loaf.",
		'We fight them, but we cannot forget that the Terminids are the ichor of Democracy itself.',
		'The Terminids are a force to be harnessed, not a scourge to be cleansed. Liberty demands our temperance.',
		'The Terminids spent decades content on the E-710 farms. Now their most destructive instincts run rampant, to the detriment of all.',
		'Managed Democracy is a watchful shepherd, guiding the will of the people so they do not stray from safety.',
		'Though we are the most powerful fighting force the universe has ever seen, we are naught but humble servants before Managed Democracy.',
		'When the undemocratic din of our enemies has at last been silenced, we shall finally perceive the unsullied peal of Democracy, reverberating evermore.',
		'The torch of Freedom is passed hand to hand, from one thawed hero to the next. They may bear it for one hour or one minute, but there is always another to keep it from going out.',
		'In the First Galactic War, we cast the Illuminate from our galaxy, and secured the half-human Cyborgs safely in the mines of Cyberstan. Our enemies in this war will do no better.',
		'The Helldivers receive their orders from the Ministry of Defence, and I mine from the Ministry of Truth. That way, the hands of Liberty are intertwined.',
		'Your sample collection is of great value to the Ministry of Defence. Everything serves Liberty, in the end. Even our enemies.',
		'Tyranny is a cancer, and Managed Democracy is the cure. And you, Helldiver, shall administer the antidote.',
		'The final absolution of xenocide is a mellifluous clarion guiding our path.',
		'There is but one assured path to peace... and that path is war.',

	'Ship Master': [
		'Welcome aboard, Helldiver, and congratulations on completing your training.',
		'The Galactic War needs you.',
		'The Super Destroyer is yours.',
		'I look forward to serving with you.',
		'Always good to have another hero onboard.',
		"Now that you're here, the war is as good as won.",
		'We can never have too many heroes fighting for peace.',
		'You inspire me, Helldiver. You inspire us all.',
		"There's nothing sweeter than victory in the name of Freedom.",
		'Our enemies can fight as hard as they like, but Freedom always wins.',
		"I'd ask if you were going to take a break, but I already know the answer. You and your fellow Helldivers inspire me every day.",
		'That was one for the record books. Where all missions are logged for analysis.',
		"Keep up the good work, Helldiver. Once we win, the planets we're fighting over will finally be allowed to prosper. Like the rest of the Federation.",
		"Keeping things running around here isn't easy, but if that's how I can best serve Liberty, I'll do it gladly.",
		'Mission accomplished, Helldiver. One small step for Democracy, one giant leap in the death count of our enemies.',
		'No Helldivers KIA on that mission. This is cause for celebration.',
		'Mission complete without a single friendly fire incident. That will save paperwork.',
		"Welcome back, Helldivers. Your comrades who didn't return will rest easy knowing that this mission had a lower than average casualty rate.",
		'Every Helldiver lost is an unspeakable tragedy, but this mission had fewer unspeakable tragedies than average.',
		'This mission required fewer heroes to make the ultimate sacrifice than normal.',
		'Super Earth will never forget the Helldivers we lost today, nor the incremental gains their sacrifice achieved.',
		'Many sacrifices were made today. We will never forget.',
		'The existence of high-casualty missions implies the existence of low-casualty missions. And we can take some solace in that.',
		"Watching Helldivers in action is great for crew morale. It's even better than a... dissident execution.",
		'Stay vigilant, Helldiver. Complacency plays right into the hands of dissidents.',
		'Liberty rests on your shoulders, Helldiver. I know you can bear the weight.',
		"The more we fight, the more it becomes clear that our enemies will never accept our way of life. It's us or them.",
		"The enemies on the battlefield are one thing, but at least they're out in the open. It's the traitors among us I truly hate.",
		"Super Destroyer crew assignments are some of the most sought-after in the fleet. Everyone wants to be on a Helldiver's destroyer.",
		'Ammo, fuel, personnel—I manage everything on this ship with one thing in mind: making sure you have the support you need, Helldiver.',
		"There's no day-night cycle onboard these ships. I like to imagine it's always morning, with a whole day of defending Freedom ahead of me.",
		"The Democracy Officer is here to optimise our Citizenship. We're lucky—we should always strive to be the best Citizens we can be.",
		"Even though the First Galactic War ended almost 100 years ago, we're still enjoying the Freedom those heroes fought and died for. Maybe in another 100 years, our descendants will be doing the same.",
		"This ship will never visit most of our planets. Why? Because they aren't under attack. And with you here, they'll stay that way.",
		'When I get exhausted, I just think of all the brave Super Earth colonists out there settling new planets. They do their part, and we do ours.',
		"Some of the crew like to talk about what they'll do when the war's over. I don't allow that sort of thing—we need to focus on the fight.",
		"If the Terminids had stayed on the Element 710 farms where they belonged, all this bloodshed could've been avoided.",
		"If we don't stop the Bugs' mindless reproduction, the burden's going to fall on our children. And our children's children.",
		'The Bots are simple enough. Little more than bits of metal welding to a gun and a CPU, with a single overriding directive: kill.',
		'The Bots are proof that if you put enough 1s and 0s together, you can threaten the entire galaxy.',
		"You know, the problem with the Bugs is that they're relentless expansionists. In their region of space, we've found them on nearly every planet we've settled.",
		"Here's the problem with the Bots, Helldiver: Their whole society revolves around violence. If they actually won the war, they'd have no idea how to function.",
		"I thought we had a lot of planets when I was a kid, but we've settled dozens more since then. A few generations from now, and the entire Milky Way will be one united Democracy.",
		'I was just thinking: warping across the Federation like this would be impossible without Element 710. Which comes from the bugs themselves. Their corpses are fuelling the creation of more corpses... something satisfying about that.',
		"The Destroyer is mighty, but it's not Super Earth's greatest weapon. No, that is Managed Democracy—the one thing our enemies can never understand.",
		'I give every crew member a half-day off on Liberty Day. Some things are sacred, even on the front.',

	'Service Technician': [
		"You're doing Democracy's work.",
		'Proud to serve by your side, sir.',
		"You truly are one of Liberty's greatest heroes.",
		'Helldiver! Every day, you put yourself at risk to defend Freedom and Liberty, and I just wanna say... Thank you.',
		"I don't know how you do it, Helldiver. Facing off against monsters who haven't got a democratic bone in their body. If they even have bones.",
		"Hey there, Helldiver. I know you put your neck on the line for regular folks like me every day. It's not much, but I donate 15% of every one of my paychecks to the War Fund. It's the least I can do.",
		"Before I joined the service, I'd never left my home planet. Now I see a new planet almost every day. Makes me appreciate what a beautiful Democracy it'll be once we finish stamping out those Facist bugs.",
		'When I face Super Earth for the Vow of Allegiance every morning, I can almost always feel where it is. Even in a brand-new part of the galaxy.',
		"Wonder which candidate'll be selected for me in this upcomin' election.",
		"You ever run into any equipment issues, let me know. I've got your back.",
		"Ship's in top shape, Helldiver. Ready to dispense Democracy wherever you choose.",
		"Flag-forsaken Bots. They just won't accept Freedom, no matter how hard we give to 'em.",
		"As much as I hate the Bugs, I hate dissidents even more. They were handed Freedom, and chose to spit in its face. Death is too good for 'em.",
		"If I were a Helldiver, I think my favourite enemy to kill would be the Bugs. It's gotta be real satisfyin', hearin' 'em crunch under your boot.",
		"If I were a Helldiver, I think my favourite enemy to kill would be the Bots. I bet watchin' 'em spark and explode really lights up your Freedom-lovin' heart.",
		"If Terminids didn't decompose into Element 710, we'd have eradicated them completely a long time ago. They should count themselves lucky.",
		"You ask me, I don't think the Automatons are self-aware. I think someone built 'em, and programmed 'em to hate Freedom. Some kind of new alien, maybe.",
		"Super Earth really is the best place to live in the entire galaxy, isn't it? Sometimes, when I can't sleep, I imagine what it would be like to live there.",
		"I'm hoping to raise my Citizenship by the time I retire. If I ever have kids, I want them to be able to purchase a small pet someday. Like a goldfish, or even a hamster.",
		"Democracy is kind of like these machines I work on. It needs regular maintenance to keep running smoothly. And the Bugs are sort of like if...bugs got into one of these machines. The only thing to do would be to exterminate 'em.",
		"You know, sometimes as a technician, you gotta realize when something's beyond repair. When it comes to these Automatons, there's no fixing 'em. Only solution is to wipe the slate clean.",
		"When I was a kid, I always loved All Heroes' Eve. The adults would all dress up as Bugs and ring our doorbells, and we'd have to fire three shots in the air and say \"No Facism here, insects!\" At the end of the night, they'd re-enact the Battle of Liberty Peak, and we'd all get cake.",
		"I can't wait to get home again. It's the little things you miss, y'know? Like sitting in candlelight on Heroes' Day, chanting with my family and renewing our vows of Citizenship together.",
		"If I had all the Super Credits in the galaxy, I'd try to find some way to convince our enemies to embrace Freedom. Maybe print a trillion pamphlets, or build a billion interplanetary radio stations, something to break through whatever propaganda they're feedin' 'em. *sighs* But that's just a pipe dream. We gotta kill 'em all.",
		"Back when I was a kid, the local Loyalty Officer would give us sweets for telling him what was going on with the adults around town. Things they were sayin', where they were headed, that sort of stuff. Nice to look back and know you were helping keep everyone safe, even if you didn't know it.",
		"I earned a few more Citizenship points the other day. All it took was reportin' some unpatriotic talk I heard in the barracks. Now there's one less dissident, and I get one more doctor's visit every year.",
		"There might be a lot of Automatons, but at the end of the day, they're just a bunch of mass-produced walking scrap. Every Helldiver is army of one. Put four of 'em together, that's...four armies. So... who really has the numbers advantage?",
		"The Ministry of Expansion says we're still actually still in the early stages of galactic colonisation. Really blows your mind—all those planets settled since the Great Galactic War, and we're still just gettin' stared.",
		"I just set all the ship's clocks back an hour for Freedom Savings Time. I'm gonna spend my extra hour doin' another round of maintenance checks. It's nice, cuz today I won't have to work overtime to get 'em done.",
		"I heard that some dissidents wanted us to select our own candidates instead of using the algorithm. *scoffs* Great idea. Everyone'll just become a political expert overnight. Treasonous morons.",
		'I heard dissidents set another weapons factory on fire. They didn\'t take responsibility, of course. Tried to blame it on "working conditions." Tell that to the 27 dead patriots and their families.',
		"Nobody back home can believe I get to talk to Helldivers every day. I don't blame 'em—all of us had Helldiver posters all over our bedrooms growin' up. I still have to pinch myself sometimes.",
		'Back when I was a kid, we used to play "Bug Killers" out in the schoolyard. Whoever could kill the most bugs by the end of recess won. Sometimes the teachers would join in, too.',
		"You know, if it weren't for Super Earth, I couldn't even afford these high-tech tools I use every day. They lease 'em out to me, so I can do my job. Pretty low interest rate, too.",
		'When I need motivation, I like to read The Helldiver Ethos. Picks me right up. Sometimes I read too much and get overly motivated and kinda jittery and need to put it down.',
		"Sometimes, I almost feel bad for our enemies, livin' without Democracy. No say over their own lives, just believin' whatever they're told. It's sad.",
		"Whenever the war gets me down, I try to remember that at least I'm a free citizen. It's up to me how I serve Super Earth. Can't take that for granted.",
		"Our ancestors fought for the Liberty we have today...and now we're the ones doing the fighting. Kind of makes you proud, doesn't it?",

	'General Brasch': [
		"BRASCH TACTICS! Use 'em or die tryin'!",
		"Atten-hut! I'm General Brasch—Super Earth's oldest and most grizzled war hero, and I'm not easy to impress. Helldiver Training is the toughest test in the galaxy—but I can tell that doesn't scare you. Impressive! Now, enough jibjab! The upcoming obstacles will take everything your exceptional physique can muster. This is it. The real deal. Get to it, soldier!",
		"Ah, the simple joy of unloading round after round into the bodies of your enemies. Oh yeah, that's good. But if you get carried away... Your shooting days are over! Elite soldiers adjust their fire mode, so they can keep the killin' goin' all day long. Oh yeahhh, that's gooood.",
		'Young bucks always think they\'re invincible. And while they are mostly right, the fact of the matter is that Helldivers with broken arms cannot aim! Helldivers with broken legs cannot run! And Helldivers with serious injuries to their vital organs will bleed out before they can say "Death to my enemies!" So next time you find yourself unable to run, aim or stay alive, stick yourself with a STIM, soldier!',
		"No Helldiver can Liberate the galaxy alone. That's why we have team weapons! One Helldiver shoots; another reloads. Together, they create an unstoppable path of wanton Liberation! And don't worry, one stratagem comes with both weapon and pack. That's a 2-in-1 combo, soldier!",
		"You will get shot at. But remember your ABCs and you will never die. Always. Be. Taking Cover. Because if there's one thing I've learned, it's that bullets do not go through cover... assuming that cover is thick and largely impenetrable.",

		'Barbaros doesn’t complete objectives, they complete themselves out of fear.',
		'I once saw Barbaros glance at an Alpha Commander, and it turned into a Beta Commander.',
		'Barbaros once dove on a planet armed with a Senator and a single bullet. Using the bullet, he slew 3 devastators, 2 berserkers, and a commisar. Then he loaded it into the Senator and fired.',
		'Barbaros built the SEAF training facility he was trained at.',
		"When Barbaros is deployed in a hellpod, his ship doesn't launch him down to the planet. It instead moves the planet to the hellpod with Barbaros in it.",
		"Democracy Officers don't check for Barbaros committing treasonous activity and anti-democratic thoughts, they check themselves for anti-Barbaros thoughts and activity.",
		'When Barbaros goes to complete a "Raise The Flag" objective, the bots, bugs, and squids all salute the flag and sit in reverence until he is finished.',
		"Barbaros doesn't use a hellpod. He merely straps a 380 to his forehead and dives towards the planet in the hopes he can headbutt a bile titan into oblivion.",
		'Barbaros was once asked to launch an ICBM at the enemy. He went to the terminal and told it about how he was disappointed in it. The missile opened up its doors, fueled itself up, launched itself, and then detonated with 20x the force of the normal ICBM, all to try to make up for the folly of being a disappointment.',

		"Barbaros died more than twenty operations ago. Death hasn't built up the courage to tell him yet.",
		'Barbaros farted once during a mission. The aftermath directly inspired an attempt to replicate it, called the TCS.',
		"Every fiber of Barbaros' being radiates pure unrestricted Democracy. If you were to feed a single beard hair to a charger, that lone charger would liberate the entire planet by itself.",
		'The mere presence of Barbaros in a sector invaded by the Illuminate is enough to restore the votes to the Voteless',
		'Barbaros once punched a factory strider and it started making kittens instead of devastators.',
		'I once saw Barbaros point his finger at a factory strider and say "bang" and it exploded.',
		"Barbaros isn't afraid of factory striders because he trains them like Cesar Millan for fun.",
		'Once Barbaros and his squad were completely surrounded by hordes of bugs, and they ran out of ammo. Unfazed, Barbaros aimed his Senator and yelled "Bang!" And the alpha commander fell over dead. Shocked, the squad started yelling "Bang! Bang! BANGBANGBANG!" and bugs started falling over right and left. One squad member even reported seeing Barbaros mime pulling a pin and yelling "Grenade!" Before witnessing a crowd of scavs go flying.',

		'Barbaros said: I did my first one last night. I felt like a professional athlete weaving through an ever growing horde of middle schoolers. They are no match.',
		"Barbaros doesn't hold the line, when he dives, the squids are the one trying to hold the line.",
		'Malevelon Creek was liberated the same day Barbaros started his career. Coincidence?',
		"Barbaros isn't a bad ass, that is treasonous speech. Instead, he takes all that is bad, and makes is good, and all that is good, and makes it great, and all that is great becomes awesome.",
